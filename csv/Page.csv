It is the first and only program of its kind in the United States.<br>â€¨Since 2009, OPRD has designated 17 Scenic Bikeways throughout Oregon, covering 1,253 miles.</p><p><br></p><p>Scenic Bikeways are nominated by local communities and designated based on scenic quality, road conditions and general riding enjoyment. Route difficulties vary&mdash;some are beginner friendly while others will challenge veteran riders&mdash;and each passes a through a distinct Oregon landscape.</p><p>â€¨Over the last decade, Scenic Bikeways have proven to be a boon for local communities: a&nbsp;study&nbsp;published by Travel Oregon found that in 2014, Scenic Bikeway cyclists spent $6.9 million on accommodations and food services and $5.3 million on retail, supporting over 150 local community jobs with earnings of approximately $3.4 million.</p><p><br></p><p>Download the Oregon Scenic Bikeways guide <a href=\"https://traveloregon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/10-Year-Anniversary-Scenic-Bikeway-Brochure_Web.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Willamette Valley Scenic Bikeways</p><p>Covered Bridges Scenic Bikeway<br>Difficulty: Mild | Length: 36 Miles<br><br>Willamette Valley<br><br>The Covered Bridges Scenic Bikeway is a family-friendly ride from a historic downtown through six historic covered bridges to a picturesque lake.<br><br>Best season: Year-round</p><p><br></p><p>Safety Tips<br>Please be aware that the Bikeway information here is advisory only. You assume all risks as far as the quality and accuracy of the information; in other words, you&rsquo;re agreeing to use it at your own risk.

For car-free riding, check out the Banks-Vernonia State Trail on the Tualatin Valley Bikeway and the Row River Trail section of the Covered Bridges Bikeway.<br><br>A must-know: In Oregon, a bicycle is legally considered a vehicle (and the same laws apply). Riding with the direction of traffic is the law; it&rsquo;s also the best way to be seen by motorists.<br><br>To demonstrate the best riding etiquette and promote good relations with motorists, please ride single-file. Riding side-by-side is legal, but only if doing so does not impede traffic. Be aware that many rural roads are used daily for commerce; there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll encounter large trucks carrying oversized loads.<br><br>Never forget about drivers&rsquo; blind spots &mdash; especially when the vehicle is turning right. If you&rsquo;re going straight at an intersection with stopped vehicles, pull in behind the first stopped vehicle in the lane and wait your turn to go, as if you were a motorist.<br><br>All bicycle riders in Oregon under 16 must wear a helmet.<br><br>For more information on riding safely and legally in Oregon, visit the <a href=\"https://www.oregon.gov/odot/programs/pages/bikeped.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon Department of Transportation</a>.</p><p><br></p>","","","0",0,"Archive",NULL,"","","",0,NULL,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Draft","","","","","","","Page",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Hood","Elk at Rosse Posse in Mollalla","<p>Rosse Posse Acres&nbsp;in Molalla is a unique attraction along the Molalla County Farm Loop in Oregon&rsquo;s Mt. Hood Territory. More than a petting zoo, this ranch is a 52-acre working elk farm renowned for giving people the chance to see these massive animals face-to-face, not to mention beautiful views of the surrounding countryside and Mt. Hood.</p> <p>Established in 2005, Rosse Posse Acres has 70 head of elk on the property, including both bulls and cows. Other animals include pygmy goats and miniature donkeys, chickens, and the ever popular \"Tucker\" the wallaby.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rosseposseacres.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/rosse-posse-elk-molalla-web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /></a></p> <p>Guided tours of the ranch are both fun and informative. They start with an educational talk at the barn that highlights the differences between antlers and horns. The expert, or \"elkspert\" also shows off elk ivory teeth while they pass around examples of cow and bull teeth as well as various examples of antlers.</p> <p>After the talk, guests head out to the handling facility, known as \"Elkatraz\" before getting some face time with the massive animals. One of the handlers calls the elk over by shouting \"candy\" which is actually whole grain oats. Make sure you have your camera handy, as this is a great photo opportunity. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to not only come away with some amazing pictures, but see the beautiful creatures and their behavior closer than most anyone else you know.</p> <p>After getting some quality time with the elk, you&rsquo;ll get the chance to play with the animals in the petting zoo. Once you&rsquo;ve had your fill in the petting zoo, head on over to the gift shop for some great elk-related items to commemorate your trip.</p> <p>Tours are scheduled by appointments, which can be made by calling (503) 829-7107 or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=alan@rosseposseacres.com\" target=\"_blank\">emailing</a>.

This park's namesake, the \"Erratic Rock\", reminds us of the multiple floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions that have shaped Yamhill Valley's landscape, activities, economy and agriculture.</p> <p>Erratic Rock State Park is a hidden Wine Country destination located between McMinnville and Sheridan. Its paved roadside access path leads visitors up to its tenant's private hillside resting place. Once there, visitors are greeted by the 90-ton artifact - and a breathtaking view of the majestic Oregon Coast Range and surrounding valley.</p> <p>What makes this rock \"Erratic\"? In geology, this term describes a composition that is different from the surrounding geology. Why is it so unique? Approximately 15,000 years ago, Erratic Rock floated from Canada to Oregon in a glacier during a cataclysmic Ice Age flood. The adventurous rock traveled across the North American continent, transported by waters similar to those credited with bringing the Yamhill Valley its diverse and varying soil types.</p> <p>Erratic Rock now serves as our historical bookmark - marking a different place and time, a reminder of the events that shaped Oregon wine and terroir. Park visitors are welcomed to drink in the views, soak in the surroundings and appreciate the events that created Oregon's fertile wine valley.</p> <p><strong>Directions from Portland</strong>: Take OR-99W to OR-18W/OR-233 S/SE Dayton Bypass.

To view the full itinerary,&nbsp;<a title=\"7 Places to Sip Between the Wonders\" href=\"wine/wine-trails/places-to-sip-between-the-wonders\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</em></p> <p>Jason Lett had what you might call an early start in the winemaking business. Growing up on The Eyrie Vineyards in Dundee as the son of David Lett &mdash; one of Oregon&rsquo;s wine pioneers &mdash; Lett started helping out at age three. &ldquo;It is my earliest memory of feeling useful. I don&rsquo;t know how helpful I actually was, but I felt useful,&rdquo; he said with a laugh.</p> <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/Jason_Lett.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Lett Eyrie Vineyards\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" />That early training stuck. Though his path took him to college, a career and other adventures &mdash; like starting his own winery &mdash;Lett eventually returned to The Eyrie, where he carries on a family legacy of pushing boundaries in winemaking.</p> <p>David and Diana Lett planted the Willamette Valley&rsquo;s first Pinot noir vines in 1965, convinced that Oregon had the right climate for excellent winemaking. Their hunch paid off in 1979 and 1980 when The Eyrie wines competed against French burgundies in Paris and Beaune &mdash; and won. &ldquo;That was a watershed moment,&rdquo; Lett said.</p> <p>The Eyrie&rsquo;s accomplishment signaled the world that Oregon was ripe for wine production. Soon, French wine makers were exploring the region and moving to the state to start their own ventures. &ldquo;We have gotten some very good neighbors in the process,&rdquo; Lett said.</p> <p>Lett said the winery, like many family businesses, was akin to having another sibling. Though he enjoyed working with this dad, the long hot days made college seem like a good idea. He pursued a degree in botany and started a career. In 1997, he returned to The Eyrie to help with the harvest. &ldquo;And I realized, &lsquo;Oh my god, this is botany!&rsquo;&rdquo; However, The Eyrie was too small a kitchen for two cooks. He started his own winery&mdash;BlackCap &mdash; in 2002. In 2005, his father offered him his present job as winemaker and vineyard manager. &ldquo;Dad stayed on as spiritual heart and technical consultant,&rdquo; Lett said. David Lett passed away in 2008.</p> <p>Today The Eyrie Vineyards comprise 118 acres, 60 of which are planted with grapes and 12 with hazelnut trees. The rest is pasture and forest. The company produces about 9,000 cases of wine annually. That&rsquo;s more than half a million glasses, which sounds like a lot, but is roughly half of the output for an average Willamette Valley winery. Staying small is intentional, Lett said. &ldquo;It is important to us that there is a single guiding philosophy behind the wine, and that is easier to achieve when there is one person overseeing the details.&rdquo;</p> <p>With vineyards in Dundee and a winery in McMinnville, The Eyrie&rsquo;s production is now half Pinot gris (it produced America&rsquo;s first) and half a mix of Pinot noir, Chardonnay and more obscure varieties like Pinot blanc, Muscat, Ottenel and Pinot meunier. Lett recently planted a new variety for Oregon &mdash; Trousseau, a red wine from the Jura region of France. &ldquo;It is very refreshing and spicy,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>Those with a taste for history (and Pinot) will be interested to know that The Eyrie is re-releasing library wines, including some of the 1975 South Block Reserve that first captured the world&rsquo;s attention in France.</p> <p>As for how Lett carries on The Eyrie legacy, Lett said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is any one way to encapsulate that. The best way to experience it is by tasting our wines.&rdquo;</p> <p>See Oregon Wine Country through Jason Lett's eyes:</p> <p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/06UbjjxYfR4\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Find It:</span></strong></p> <p><strong>The Eyrie Vineyards</strong> | 935 East 10th Ave. McMinnville OR 97128 | 503-472-6315 |&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.eyrievineyards.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eyrievineyards.com</a></p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,80,"Archive",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Published",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Page",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Try a pair of work boots instead. Because there&rsquo;s one thing that the Willamette Valley&rsquo;s chefs, farmers, and winemakers agree on: the best food and wine starts on a farm. Here&rsquo;s how to take this trip through seven fabulous farms in Oregon Wine Country:</em></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start your journey in Albany with a walk through the wild loveliness of <a href=\"http://www.midwayfarmsoregon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Midway Farms\"><strong>Midway Farms</strong></a>, a 100-percent organic farm whose owners are so serious about working in harmony with nature that they leave certain plots of land undisturbed to promote healthy insect habitat. Old-fashioned fruits like quince and gooseberry grow side-by-side with herbs, flowers and veggies, and visitors are welcome to wander through it all. Bring your kids to a farm day camp in the summer or bring a friend to one of Midway&rsquo;s seasonal wine and cheese tasting parties with live music.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Head north to Salem, where the melt-in-your-mouth goodness of <a href=\"http://www.thecherrycountry.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cherry Country Orchard\"><strong>Cherry Country Orchar</strong></a>d will make your tastebuds happy whether you&rsquo;re searching for fresh fruits or delectable desserts. Located in the hills west of Salem, the farmers at Cherry Country Orchard grow 37 acres of fresh cherries, then make a good thing even better by dipping their bounty in chocolate. Visitors can sample fresh, dried and chocolate-coated cherries at the farm and candy factory.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Continue through the Willamette Valley&rsquo;s green fields and rolling hills, northward to the farmland outside Molalla, where you&rsquo;ll find <strong><a href=\"http://www.rosseposseacres.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rosse Posse Acres\">Rosse Posse Acre</a>s</strong>, a farm like nothing you&rsquo;ve experienced before. Yes, it&rsquo;s a working ranch, where the Ross family raises flavorful local elk meat that finds its way to fine kitchens all over Oregon. But it&rsquo;s also a place where visitors can get up close and personal with majestic herds of elk in a way you won&rsquo;t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> From Molalla, turn west toward the Willamette River. There, in the heart of Oregon Wine Country, you&rsquo;ll come upon <strong><a href=\"http://champoegcreamery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Champoeg Creamery\">Champoeg Creamery</a></strong>, where a handful of contented Jersey cows graze on green pastures, and family farmers turn that goodness into fresh milk and cheese. Customers drive for miles to purchase Champoeg&rsquo;s farm-fresh milk, and adults and children alike can sign up for classes and camps to experience hands-on farm tasks like milking the cows, hunting for eggs and making cheese.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Do yourself a favor and come hungry when you visit <strong><a href=\"http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gathering Together Farm\">Gathering Together Farm</a></strong> outside Corvallis. The&nbsp;<img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/Gathering_Together_4-small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" class=\"fr-fir fr-dii\">Farmstand Restaurant at Gathering Together takes grown-on-site organic produce and turns it into mouthwatering brunches, delectable salads, wood-fired pizzas, and more. If you can&rsquo;t stay for a full meal, grab a house-made pastry or loaf of bread and munch while you browse the selection of veggies, local honey, jams and jellies. You&rsquo;ll leave with a full belly and a happy heart.</p><p><img src=\"https://wvva.objects.liquidweb.services/photos/img_1987.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii fr-fil\" style=\"width: 362px; height: 361px;\"><strong>6.</strong> If Gathering Together wasn&rsquo;t proof enough that everything tastes better on a farm, <strong><a href=\"http://agales.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Agrarian Ales\">Agrarian Ales</a></strong> will win your heart (and your tastebuds) entirely. This family-owned chili pepper farm turned brewery produces farm-brewed beers that will knock your socks off. And while you&rsquo;re barefoot, you might as well play &mdash; Agrarian&rsquo;s onsite pub and brewery features yard games, a giant Jenga set, and even hula hoops. Unleash your inner child and enjoy yourself while you sip craft beverages and farm-inspired dining just north of Eugene.</p><p><strong>7</strong>. An honorable mention on any list of seven top farms in Oregon Wine Country goes to <strong><a href=\"https://www.oregonfarmersmarkets.org/find-a-market\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Farmers Markets\">Willamette Valley Farmers&rsquo; Markets.</a></strong> Any day of the week in the Willamette Valley, you can find local producers setting up tents in vacant fields and city parking lots, putting their best berries and prettiest peaches out where foodies can trek in to purchase their local food nirvana. Whether you&rsquo;re searching for artisan cheese, fresh berries, Oregon hazelnuts, or one of the multitudes of other crops that we&rsquo;ve perfected in the Willamette Valley, there&rsquo;s a farmers&rsquo; market not far away where you can find the mouthwatering morsel of your dreams.

In fact, the neighboring town of Monmouth was the last West Coast town in the United States to repeal its dry status in 2002. &nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, any vestige of prohibition is long gone, so try this weekend itinerary to explore this burgeoning community with an entrepreneurial vibe.</p><p>Stay in a vineyard cabin: The one of kind 1930&rsquo;s renovated cabin on Lumos Vineyard, was a former H Bar H Dude Ranch.

Arlie has been women owned and operated since 1986 and features dry Pinot blanc, barrel fermented Chardonnay, M&uuml;ller Thurgau, Mar&eacute;chal Foch, and Oregon&rsquo;s famed Pinot noir.</p><p>Next stop on Arlie Road is the family owned and operated Emerson Winery where you can enjoy estate grown Pinot noir and the Friday Summer Music Series.</p><p>After Emerson, head south on Hwy 223 towards Philomath to the tasting room at Cardwell Hills, another Salmon-Safe winery to taste the multitude of award winning wines with names like &ldquo;The Bard Chard&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old Vines Pinot Noir&rdquo; which garnered a 91 point award from the famed James Suckling.</p><p>And then it&rsquo;s time for Happy hour cocktails at Harris Bridge Vineyards, which are accompanied by complimentary recipes and original poetry inspired by the location on every bottle. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Harris Bridge Cocktail recipe:</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">A Dream Rooted:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">2 oz Reverie sweet vermouth</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1 oz gin</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1 bar spoon Benedictine</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">1 splash ginger beer</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Mix first 3 ingredients with ice, strain, add splash of ginger beer,</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Add a twist of orange peel and serve!</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Harris Bridge Vineyard winemakers Nathan and Amanda Sever make Pinot gris and Pinot noir vermouth, aperitifs, dessert wines, and brandy. The duo harvests their grapes around 23 brix, earlier than traditional ice wines or other &ldquo;late harvest&rdquo; dessert wines, which gives the wine finished wine acidity to balance the sweetness. Visit the winery for an experience beyond the bottle with a walk to the river and historic covered bridge, games on the grass, and picnics under the oaks.</p><p><br></p><p>Time for Thai or Americana? Head to dinner at the Woodsman, a hidden gem in what was once a lumberjack town. Although the name, decor, and type of food all seemed to contradict each other in this former logger bar, when Nong Sisovahn bought the establishment she introduced a Thai menu to the standard American fare and made it all work.

Afterwards, get some more homemade goodness next door at Nutcakes Donut Bakery.</p><p><br></p><p>Soft Star Shoes Founders Tim and Jeannie Oliver learned to sew soft leather shoes from a local artisan after they couldn&rsquo;t &nbsp;find healthy shoes for their daughter. Their first official shoemaking workshop was in a renovated school bus and thirty years later they are still in a repurposed building in downtown Philomath, the former &ldquo;Philo-O-Rink&rdquo; roller skating rink. Watch &ldquo;the elves&rdquo; at work creating handmade shoes and don&rsquo;t forget to take a turn on the indoor slide.</p><p>After your artisan tour, explore one of Oregon&rsquo;s smallest productions facilities at Panache, &nbsp;the &ldquo;nano-winery&rdquo; in Jim Day&rsquo;s garage, only five minutes from downtown Philomath. Despite the wineries pint sized locale, they produce flagship Pinot Noir, &nbsp;and award-winning Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc, Tempranillo and Sangiovese.</p><p>Ten minutes from Panache is another urban nano winery, Pheasant Court, where owners Charlie and Marcia Gilson manage to create an impressive variety of wines, including distinctive big reds and dessert wines harvested from grapes in Southern Oregon and Walla Walla Washington vineyards.</p><p>Ready for lunch yet? Head back to downtown Philomath to &nbsp;Eats &amp; Treats Cafe, a &nbsp;gluten free eatery with a relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Try the BBQ pulled pork, chicken, turkey and ham smoked on site by owner Sandy McHenry. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough, visit on Friday &nbsp;when it&rsquo;s Tri-tip Day. That&rsquo;s when you will see Sandy, in his cowboy hat, fire up the &ldquo;Big Rig&rdquo; with oak wood and set to work on slow-cooking mouth-watering, Santa Maria Style Tri-tip.</p><p>Feel like walking ? You won&rsquo;t have to go far to visit the distilleries of Philomath. Visit Marcotte Distillery to taste one of Oregon&rsquo;s first flavored small batch Moonshine producers. The Marcotte&rsquo;s have created &nbsp;twenty different amazing flavors ranging from fruit, to cream and coffee liqueurs, including seasonal options. Enjoy two - ounce pours at the tasting bar of the popular Ella&rsquo;s Silver Moon, Aimee Jo&rsquo;s Strawberry Lemonade and Broc&rsquo;s Buttery Coconut. And don&rsquo;t pass by the mega or mini &ldquo;Mooners Club&rdquo; so you can have your &lsquo;shine shipped to your doorstep!</p><p>One mile from Marcotte is the new Taproom at Nectar Creek Mead. 100 percent of the honey local brothers and owners Phillip and Nick Lorenz use for the carbonated, refreshing brew is raw and sourced directly from sustainable beekeepers. Along with a sampler flight, &nbsp;try a can of &nbsp;the year round session mead flavors Sting ginger, Waggle Wildflower or Cluster Cranberry/Strawberry with a salmon sampler from the new bar menu.</p><p>And there&rsquo;s still time and to walk downtown a few blocks east for happy hour at Spindrift Vineyards, which recently added a second Compton Family label.</p><p>One last meal to top off your day.

Kids don&rsquo;t need textbooks when they can immerse themselves in hands-on exhibits, like those at the <em><strong>A.C. Gilbert&rsquo;s Discovery Village</strong></em> in Salem. Stop in at the <strong><em>Little Gem Candy Store&nbsp;</em></strong>on your way home for that favorite childhood sweet, or continue to reminisce by taking a turn on an Oregon-themed horse at the <em><strong>Salem River Front Carousel</strong></em>. This old-world style carousel is enjoyable for all ages; just close your eyes and become a kid again.</p><p align=\"left\">Visit the Wild West, run the river in a log canoe, or take a walk down storybook lane - all to the sounds of fairy-tale music and children&rsquo;s laughter at the<em><strong>&nbsp;Enchanted Forest</strong></em>. Children young and old can visit an authentic English village or haunted house before taking in a kaleidoscope of lights during the daily Fantasy Fountain&rsquo;s Water-Light show. If that&rsquo;s not enough to satisfy, check out <em><strong>Thrill-Ville USA</strong></em>, Oregon&rsquo;s premier &ldquo;family fun spot.&rdquo; This park features two giant waterslides, Go-Karts, Blaster Boats, thrill rides, and a kiddie section. Great food, strolling costumed characters, and live entertainment round out the experience.</p><p align=\"left\">Take a seat in the Governor&rsquo;s chair at the <em><strong>Oregon State Capitol</strong></em>. Parents can photograph their future lawmakers as they help to draft legislation in the ceremonial office where bills are signed and press conferences are held. Guided tours will teach you about the history of Oregon, the Capitol building and the state&rsquo;s legislative process. When the legislature is in session, visitors can sit in the Gallery above the House and Senate floors to watch proceedings in person. Before you leave, climb to the <em><strong>Golden Pioneer</strong></em>, a symbol that sits atop the capitol, honoring the sacrifices made by pioneers on the Oregon Trail. From here, you can see the city of Salem and catch a glimpse of the green fields of the valley beyond. Everyone who makes it to the top will receive a certificate of achievement signed by the Governor.</p><p align=\"left\">The historic <em><strong>Mission Mill Museum</strong></em> offers hands-on activities for kids to experience how life once was. Ever wonder what it was like to be a pioneer? Take part in traditional crafts and children&rsquo;s games, or watch reenactments of Kalapuya Indian activities. With Mill Creek running through the grounds, the museum is a tranquil park-like destination.</p><p align=\"left\">Hear a ball crack against the bat and enjoy a hotdog smothered in mustard at a <em><strong>Salem-Keizer Volcanoes</strong></em> baseball game. The club was named the &ldquo;Best Class A Short Season Franchise&rdquo; in the nation by Baseball America.</p><p align=\"left\">Enjoy a family dinner while taking in a movie at the <em><strong>Northern Lights Theater Pub</strong></em>. Early shows are open to all ages and the theater serves kid friendly food along with adult fare. From light comedies to PG-rated action flicks, this theater has films the whole family can agree on.</p><p align=\"left\">Whether you&rsquo;d like to stay within walking distance of the Capitol, downtown historic district and shops, or you&rsquo;d prefer a unique bed and breakfast beside a scenic vineyard, the Salem area offers diverse lodgings that cater to every need and many that come complete with fireplaces, Jacuzzis and pools, as well as restored historic homes and full breakfast fare.</p><blockquote><p align=\"left\">Salem Convention &amp; Visitors Association<br>1313 Mill St SE, Salem, OR<br>503.581.4325<br><a href=\"http://www.travelsalem.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.travelsalem.com</a></p><p align=\"left\">A.C.

It&rsquo;s perfect for kayaking, canoeing and fishing&mdash;or, bring scuba diving gear and explore the submerged 3,000-year-old forest within its blue-green waters.<br /><br />Formed 3,000 years ago when a volcanic eruption blocked a mountain spring, the newly-formed lake covered up surrounding forest land, and the coldness of its alpine waters has kept those ancient trees preserved in the depths of the lake. Freshwater divers consider it one of Oregon&rsquo;s best scuba diving spots.<br /><br />If you prefer to explore from the surface, rent a rowboat from the Clear Lake Resort on the lakeshore. To preserve the serenity of the lake, no motorized watercraft are allowed, so let yourself bask in the serenity of your surroundings. Peer over the side and you&rsquo;ll be able to see down to the lakebed, where the ancient lava flows and forests are still visible. Cast a line, and you may be rewarded with a bite from a cutthroat trout.<br /><br />You can grab a hearty burger and fries from the restaurant at Clear Lake Lodge, but make sure you save room for dessert&mdash;the lodge specializes in homemade fruit pies. If you&rsquo;re there on a Saturday morning, stop in for one of their famous homemade cinnamon rolls before they&rsquo;re all gone.<br /><br />Trails encircle the lake, so explore the surrounding forests, where Douglas firs tower above you and waterfalls rush down the hills. Mt. Washington&rsquo;s stone spire and the peaks of the Three Sisters are visible on a clear day. After boating and hiking, you can choose from one of Clear Lake&rsquo;s historic cabins with rustic accommodations, or a modern cabin with electricity, kitchen facilities and showers. Build a fire in Clear Lake&rsquo;s historic stone fireplace, built by the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps, and watch the starlight reflect off the lake water&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like the serenity of a night in the Cascades.<br /><br />For more mountain adventures in the Linn County area, visit <a href=\"http://www.albanyvisitors.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.albanyvisitors.com</a></p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,80,"Archive",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Published",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Page",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Situated at 4,097 feet above sea level, you can hike, bike, camp or picnic there. Don&rsquo;t forget to visit the scenic botanical area, featuring a lush meadow surrounded by stately noble fir trees. Wildflowers peak in late June and early July, and on a clear day you can see the ocean to the west and the Cascade Mountain Range to the east.</p> <p><strong>Alsea Falls</strong>&nbsp;is located 13 miles west of Monroe, Oregon in Benton County. The south fork of the Alsea River flows through the Alsea Falls Recreation site, cascading down to form the falls. Wander through trails and enjoy beautiful surroundings that lead to picnic grounds and beyond.</p> <p>Just to the south of Corvallis you&rsquo;ll find the&nbsp;<strong>William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge</strong>, situated along foothills of the Coast Range. The refuge encompasses a diverse assortment of habitats and its primary goal is to provide a wintering habitat for geese, especially the dusky Canada goose. It&rsquo;s a great place for bird watching, nature walks, hiking, photography and more.</p> <p>Wonders of the man-made variety include Corvallis&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong>historic downtown</strong>&nbsp;with many buildings that date back to the 1800s. This includes the Benton County Courthouse, an iconic building which is also the oldest courthouse in Oregon still used for its original purpose. Today other historic buildings house many locally-owned shops and restaurants. These unique buildings add to the overall charm and appeal of our downtown core.</p> <p>Downtown is bordered by the beautiful&nbsp;<strong>Riverfront Commemorative Park</strong>, and Benton County is home to three stately Covered Bridges. Benton County&rsquo;s final wonder encompasses one of the things the Willamette Valley is most famous for- our local Heart of Willamette Wineries!</p> <p>For more information, please visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.visitcorvallis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.visitcorvallis.com</a>&nbsp;<br /> <em>(photo provided by: Lainey Dyer)</em></p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,80,"Archive",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Published",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Page",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Spend one evening at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.agales.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Agrarian Ales</a>&nbsp;and you&rsquo;ll see why. The brewery sits on a 25-acre family farm 13 miles north of Eugene in the Willamette Valley. Ben and Nate Tilley started Agrarian as a way to return to their roots. The brothers grew up on their parent&rsquo;s chili pepper farm, which is on the same property as the brewery, and wanted to share that love for the country and Oregon&rsquo;s bounty with others.</p> <p>A Place To Taste<br /> Housed in a converted 1940&rsquo;s dairy barn, Agrarian&rsquo;s tasting room is surrounded by hop vines and cherry orchards. As you sip your saison, Agrarian&rsquo;s speciality, you see the organic hop vines (ten different varieties) responsible for the liquid magic. A wood fired pizza oven turns vegetables, artisan cheeses, and meats from neighboring farms into a truly farm-to-table pairing.</p> <p>A Place to Play<br /> Many breweries serve outstanding craft beer and food. But Agrarian has something else. The rural setting means that there is plenty of space where you can have fun in the sun (and the rain too, the heat lamps work like a charm). Hula hoops, a giant Jenga set, backyard games, and even a wooden play structure for the kiddos, free you from the day&rsquo;s responsibilities, allowing you to breathe the fresh countryside air and feel the grass between your toes.</p> <p>The first pints are free to those who pedal to the brewery. A slight detour from the Willamette Valley Scenic Bikeway, Agrarian is along a popular cycling route.</p> <p>At Agrarian, it&rsquo;s about good beer and quality ingredients. But most importantly, it&rsquo;s about the community and experiencing the absolute best of Oregon&rsquo;s hospitable bounty.</p> <p>For more information, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/</a></p> <p>For summer deals on dining, lodging and adventures, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/visitors/deals\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/visitors/deals/</a></p> <p><br /> <em>(photo provided by: Sally McAleer)</em></p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,81,"Archive",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Published",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Page",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In the foothills of those mountains, you&rsquo;ll find the renowned McKenzie River National Recreation Trail. An hour east of Eugene, the MRT, as it&rsquo;s known to locals, follows the McKenzie River from its headwaters at Clear Lake to the town of McKenzie Bridge. As it continues west, the pure and pristine McKenzie River pours into the south Willamette Valley, providing an ideal water source for the area&rsquo;s 17 wineries and more than a dozen craft breweries.</p> <p>It won&rsquo;t take you long to see why the MRT has been called the #1 Best Trail in America. The MRT brings 26.5 miles worth of adventure, natural beauty and a topaz-blue pool that will knock your hiking, running and mountain biking socks off. Venture over lava beds, under 600-year-old Douglas fir forests to thundering Koosah and Sahalie Falls. Traverse handmade log bridges over streams and beds of billowing ferns from Trailbridge Reservoir to Tamolitch Pool, the bluest water you&rsquo;ve ever seen. This is where the mineral-rich McKenzie River emerges from a three-mile subterranean craw through basalt lava tubes, the azure water so clear sometimes you can see more than 100 feet to the bottom.</p> <p>While the Tamolitch tempts with its tantalizing beauty, the water is very cold. Save your swimming cravings for the riverside hot springs at Belknap Hot Springs Resort. Surrounded by the Willamette National Forest, Belknap Resort offers lodge rooms, cabins and tent camping.

He first planted his vines in 1978, making his winery the first in Oregon&rsquo;s Mt. Hood Territory and among the first in the state. His passion for the science and artistry behind winemaking and for helping others successfully start their own businesses helped solidify Oregon as a premier viticultural destination.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Willamette Valley&rsquo;s climate is perfect for creating big, bold Pinot Noirs, and St. Josef&rsquo;s are no different. Done in the classic Burgundian style, this variety is known as the wine that put the Willamette Valley on the map. But one should be careful not to overlook the many other varietals crafted from the estate-grown vines and nearby vineyards in St. Josef&rsquo;s lineup. The merlot has a fine fruit bouquet with a light finish and the mighty cabernet sauvignon is a complex wine with a deep body.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, St. Josef&rsquo;s selection of white wines have an outstanding reputation as well. The white Riesling is immensely popular with its floral bouquet and semi-sweet flavor, while the pinot gris is a light, easy-to-drink wine that pairs well with many foods or is perfectly suited to enjoy alone.&nbsp;</p> <p>A number of other whites and even desert wines round out the lineup, giving wine-lovers ample reason to return to this winery again and again to sample each of the offerings. Savvy travelers time their journeys to coincide with annual events such as the winemaker&rsquo;s dinners in February, summer music series, grape stomp in September or harvest festival in October. More active souls can take part in their spring countryside half marathon or the bike ride and brisket event.</p> <p>When these fun events are paired with the scenic views surrounding this picturesque winery and the award-winning wines, it is no wonder how this affable vintner and his family have become fixtures in Oregon&rsquo;s wine scene.&nbsp;</p> <div><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Find it:</strong></span></div> <div><strong>St. Josefs Winery</strong> | 28836 S.

They quickly outgrew their home-based operation, which prompted the family to open &ldquo;<a title=\"The Campus\" href=\"http://www.gilgameshbrewing.com/menu\" target=\"_blank\">The Campu</a>s,&rdquo; a 130-seat restaurant, bar and outdoor event venue which officially opened its doors in November 2012.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We wanted to create a place where people felt comfortable hanging out,&rdquo; says Nick Radtke. With that premise in mind, the restaurant features two cozy fireplaces (one inside and one outside), an open beam ceiling and lots of natural light. Quirky details &ndash; like lamps made from recycled metal kegs and mason jars &ndash; add a rustic feel. An outdoor patio and lawn area backs up against Pringle Creek, providing the ideal spot for dining and sipping al fresco.&nbsp;</p> <p>Craft beer enthusiasts will be delighted to learn that The Campus features at least 12 Gilgamesh beers on tap at any given time, plus local wines and hard cider.

Plus, there will be plenty of parties and celebrations in store for your visit.</p><h2><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Total Solar Eclipse Facts and Figures:</span></strong></h2><ul><li><strong>How long will the total solar eclipse last (in totality)?</strong> Approximately 1 minute and 44 seconds</li><li><strong>What time will is the eclipse?</strong> It depends on your position in the Willamette Valley, but a Valley average puts totality at approximately 10:15 a.m.</li><li><strong>How long should I plan on viewing the eclipse?</strong> In total, it is about a 2 &frac12; hour event</li><li><strong>What is the safest way to view the total eclipse?</strong> Boy are we glad you asked. Complete totality is the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">only time it is safe to view the sun without optical protection</span></strong>. See below for specific viewing safety tips.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/justin-ng-total-solar-eclipse-march-2016-composite.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Observing the Eclipse:</span></strong></p><p>The only safe way to look directly at the un-eclipsed or partially eclipsed sun is through special-purpose solar filters, such as &ldquo;eclipse glasses&rdquo; &nbsp;or handheld solar viewers. Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses, even very dark ones, are not safe for looking at the sun.</p><p>Eclipse glasses should be worn whenever even a part of the sun can be seen; only during totality when the moon has slid fully in front of the sun is it safe to take off one&rsquo;s eclipse glasses. In fact, observing those brief seconds of totality without eclipse glasses is encouraged because it&rsquo;s possible during this time to see the outer atmosphere of the sun and its streamers, loops and plumes of gas. Check out these great <a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/safety\">eclipse-viewing safety tips</a> from NASA.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A few things to remember:</strong></p><ul><li>Protect your vision; do not look directly at the Sun during the 2 1/2 hours. It is only safe to view the Sun during the 1:44 minutes of totality.&nbsp;</li><li>Eye equipment: Proper eclipse glasses or filters must be used to observe the partial phase before or after totality. Stay tuned to find out where find glasses in the Willamette Valley</li><li>Binoculars can only be used during totality</li><li>Telescopes are for experts only</li><li>Cameras are not recommended. Again, probably for experts only. If you must capture this moment on camera make sure you time for the event and do not look into the viewfinder during the eclipse, except when it is in totality.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t use anything that is not designed for viewing a solar eclipse</li><li>Don&rsquo;t use sunglasses</li><li>Bottom line: For many, this is a once in a lifetime event. Just enjoy it and live in the moment. You don&#39;t want it to pass you by while you fiddle with your devices.</li></ul><p>If you plan to view the solar eclipse in the Willamette Valley, pick up our Solar Eclipse safety glasses, available (while supplies last) this summer at <a href=\"about-us\">Willamette Valley visitors centers</a>, and at participating hotels and campgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/may_20_2012_eclipse_viewing_at_arches_7337711910.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Photo Courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.outdoorproject.com/blog-news/where-watch-augusts-solar-eclipse\">Outdoor Project</a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Event Information:</span></strong></p><p>Now you know <em>how</em> to view a Solar Eclipse, but where should you view this epic event? And where can you stay before and after? Many eclipse enthusiasts host parties in local community centers, museums, observatories, parks or open fields. Even your own backyard is a good place to throw a party. It is always a good idea to choose a place that has access to shade and facilities. You may also want to check weather-related web sites for forecasts for your area - and don&#39;t forget your safety glasses!</p><p>If you prefer a party, you&#39;re in luck. Viewing celebrations big and small will be happening in just about every corner of the Willamette Valley on August 21. In Salem don&#39;t miss the opportunity to view the event in the hustle and bustle of the Capitol Mall. In the Corvallis area take in the epic event after a refreshing goat-yoga session at Emerson vineyard. In Albany, join the party in the path at the historic airport. Many vineyards throughout the Valley would be happy if you stopped by for a sip a or two of Pinot Noir while you are in the path.</p><p>Keep an eye on these listings and find the right party for your best 2017 solar eclipse experience.</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><a href=\"https://www.travelsalem.com/events/total-solar-eclipse-2017\">Salem</a></span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><a href=\"http://visitcorvallis.com/oregon-state-university/8-21-2017-total-solar-eclipse-corvallis-oregon/\">Corvallis</a></span></li><li><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><a href=\"https://www.mthoodterritory.com/blog/upcoming-solar-eclipse-a-harbinger-of-awesomeness/\">Mt.

If you&rsquo;re up to it, tackle the hills on Sulpher Springs Road or the impressive climb to Mary Peak- at 4097 foot elevation, it&rsquo;s the highest peak in the Oregon Coast Range. &nbsp;The summit offers panoramic views of the Willamette Valley, the Coast Range, the Cascades and the Pacific Ocean.</p> <p>If you want to combine biking with a wildlife viewing, cycle down to William L.

Afterward, a 60-minute visit to Threshold Fitness was just what to doctor ordered to get the blood flowing and burn a few calories before checking into charming B&amp;B <a href=\"http://ovaldoor.com\">The Oval Door,</a> which serves a customizable vegan breakfast each morning that for us included br&ucirc;l&eacute;ed citrus, non-dairy yogurt, housemade granola, and tofu scrambles. After a restful afternoon, we started our night at <a href=\"http://www.oregonwinelab.com\">Oregon Wine LAB</a> for Pinot Bingo featuring trivia and vegan wines (the red ones are vegan). After getting a buzz, we walked 20 minutes (five minutes if you&rsquo;re in a cab) to <a href=\"http://www.cornbreadcafe.com\">Cornbread Cafe</a> for vegan takes on comfort food classics such as chicken fried seitan and a French dip sandwich. After dinner, we tried some of Eugene&rsquo;s handcrafted cider at <a href=\"https://wildcraftciderworks.com\">Wild Craft Cider Works</a>, where flavors range from wild plum and elderberry to cherry and wild rose.

Our tasting began with a lovely Pinot Gris, followed by an unoaked Chardonnay whose minerality and notes of vanilla and tropical fruit will convert any Chardonnay nay-sayer. As much as we enjoyed the Chardonnay, the award-winning 2014 Estate Pinot Noir and its premium cousin Estate Barrel Select were our faves from the visit. We came to taste and take in the sprawling property (and get in a few snuggles with the resident winery dog) and ended up leaving with a case of wine. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://wvva.objects.liquidweb.services/photos/1053-bethelheights_salem-600x400.webp 596w, https://wvva.objects.liquidweb.services/photos/1053-bethelheights_salem-600x400-thumb.webp 300w\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://wvva.objects.liquidweb.services/photos/1053-bethelheights_salem-600x400.jpg 596w, https://wvva.objects.liquidweb.services/photos/1053-bethelheights_salem-600x400-thumb.jpg 300w\"><img src=\"https://wvva.objects.liquidweb.services/photos/1053-bethelheights_salem-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 402px; height: 267.101px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii fr-fil\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><em><br></em></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A stop in Salem for salad, kombucha and a hearty veggie burger at <a href=\"http://ventiscafe.com\">Venti&rsquo;s Cafe</a> is an excellent place to fill up on the road.

We were on a Pinot mission, so we skipped the whites and went straight for the 2016 Whole Cluster and 2015 Estate Pinot Noirs.

From there, we visited <a href=\"https://www.beauxfreres.com\">Beaux Fr&egrave;res</a> for amazingly delicate Pinot from a winemaker who utilizes clean fermentation and indigenous yeast. Our last tasting was at <a href=\"http://www.duckpondcellars.com\">Duck Pond Cellars</a>, a winery previously known for more commercial styles, but new winemaker Trevor Chlanda is upending the brand&rsquo;s status quo by creating a new generation of wines focused on texture and great aromatics to best represent the vineyards from where they come.

With more than 500 wineries in this AVA (American Viticultural Area), the Valley offers more than enough variety for wine lovers.&nbsp;</p><p>Take a wine trail in the northern portion of the Valley and you will be hard pressed to find a winery that does not have at least one Pinot Noir on its tasting menu. In fact, it may be the only varietal they produce. Still, other grapes are also grown, but to a smaller volume.</p><p>With favorable climate and unique soil types, it is no wonder that Oregon Pinot Noir has reached world-class status. Another grape that does well in this naturally cool climate is Chardonnay. Expressing flavors such as apple, pear, and citrus, and with only a modicum of oak aging, the Willamette Valley is on a good trajectory for making respected and sought-after Chardonnays, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the variety of wines available in the Willamette Valley, where Pinot Noir is considered king, it&rsquo;s the variety of stories behind the wineries themselves that might be most surprising.</p><p>As co-owners of <a href=\"https://www.thevineyardtrail.com\">The Vineyard Trail</a>, a company focused on bringing wine lovers and wineries together in the tasting room, we were lucky enough to be invited to visit this special wine growing region, and to have the opportunity to sit and talk with the owners, winemakers and staff at a number of Willamette Valley vineyards and wineries; these are some of their stories.</p><p><img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/Ghost-Hill-Cellars-Wine-Tasting-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"456\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p>Photo courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.platingsandpairings.com/ghost-hill-cellars-wine-tasting-winewednesday/\">Erin Lynch</a></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ghosthillcellars.com\">Ghost Hill Cellars</a>&nbsp;</strong>12220 NE Bayliss Rd, Carlton, OR 97111, 503-852-7347</p><p>If you happen to be traveling through the Yamhill-Carlton AVA and you feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, it is possible that you may have some unexpected company. &nbsp;It just might be that you have been joined by the long-time legend of Ghost Hill, a ghostly gold miner from the late 1800&#39;s who, along with his horse, was killed, leaving only their carcasses and an empty bag of gold. Some folks say that he continues to wander the hill searching for his stolen fortune and the men who took his life so long ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharing the land are Michael and Drenda Bayliss, owners of Ghost Hill Cellars. Their 234 rolling acres have been in Michael&#39;s family since 1906 and have been farmed throughout the years with wheat, hay, clover, peas, sheep, cattle, and yes, now grapes. Michael and Drenda now focus on Pinot Noir and produce four different offerings, two red Pinot Noirs (different clones), a Pinot Ros&eacute;, and a not commonly produced, Pinot Noir Blanc.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping with the ghostly legend, they have built a charming and fun open-air tasting room modeled to resemble a miner&#39;s shack. While we didn&rsquo;t see any ghosts ourselves, we can only imagine that Michael and Drenda are expecting company - company of the ghost-like fashion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/Alloro_Vineyard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"314\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.allorovineyard.com/Alloro_Vineyard/Home.html\">Alloro Vineyard</a>&nbsp;</strong>22075 SW Lebeau Road, Sherwood, OR 97140, (503) 625-1978</p><p>From well-known Portland produce suppliers, the Nemarnik&rsquo;s, comes Alloro Vineyards. Established in 1999, with 33 acres of vines comprising Chardonnay, Riesling, and Pinot Noir, the vines are tended to in an Old World style, employing a holistic approach to farming.&nbsp;</p><p>David Nemarnik, owner, follows the long-time heritage of sustainability and biodiversity by raising chicken, cattle, sheep, and very soon to be added, pigs. He grows hay for the livestock and uses their manure for fertilizing the vines. The sheep help manage the growth of the cover crop, and the multiple kinds of produce farmed on the land are used as sustenance on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p><p>The commitment to this farming philosophy is not completely surprising seeing as David spent much of his youth visiting his relatives in Italy and Croatia surrounded by their old-world style of living, which has continued from generation to generation. David also spent many years working with his family to grow a successful produce company and was taught to enjoy each meal at a respectful pace, and always indulge in a glass of wine and good conversation.</p><p>But David is not completely entrenched in the Old World. He employs New World technology such as electricity generating solar panels that produce 100% of the estate&#39;s energy needs and enough surplus to supply the rest of the grid.</p><p>And, each September, David and Alloro bring his family&rsquo;s values to the people with their Whole Farm Dinner, for which they use produce and meat directly from the farm, prepared by a local chef to celebrate the success of the harvest. This event is highly awaited and sells out quickly each year.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that is a community! And all of this in the name of family and great wine!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/lenne_Estate.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.lenneestate.com\">Lenn&eacute; Estate</a>&nbsp;</strong>18760 NE Laughlin Road, Yamhill, OR 97148, 03-956-2256</p><p>Have you ever known a good thing immediately when you saw it? Well, Steve Lutz sure did when he first saw the property that is now home to Lenn&eacute; Estate. Steve, the proprietor and vintner, stumbled across the land &ndash; which wasn&#39;t even for sale at the time &ndash; and within an hour was drawing up a contract for the sale. Steve claims that it is the &quot;worst soil ever&quot; in which to grow grapes and says that, even still, he is the luckiest grape grower in the world. The hill is steep and the soil is nutrient poor, yet somehow his Pinot Noir vines seem to thrive in their new home, producing small clusters and berries that showcase a hint of mocha flavor.&nbsp;</p><p>In reality, their home is not all that new as the vines were actually planted in 2001. During our sit-down with Steve, he happily retold his story of the vineyard&rsquo;s trials, tribulations and successes over the past 16 years. With a smile and a chuckle, he started off by saying that you have to be either stupid or have a lot of guts to get into the winery business, and in his case, which one was questionable.&nbsp;</p><p>He recalled, that year after year they were &ldquo;burning through money&rdquo; because the soil was so difficult to get the vines to grow in. In fact, in year four, they lost an entire block of newly planted vines and were very close to calling it quits. But once again, whether stupidity or guts prevailed, Steve replanted and tried again.</p><p>Holding their breath seemed to be an everyday occurrence for the Lutzes. It wasn&rsquo;t until Steve tasted his 2004 vintage, the first fruit of his labor, for the first time that he felt comfortable breathing normally again. He recalled going home to his wife and happily telling her that she need no longer worry because he had just tasted their first vintage and they were going to be just fine.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew what we had in the site, but when I tasted that first sip and it tasted like a chocolate covered black cherry, I just knew what we had,&rdquo; Steve told us.</p><p>Since that time, Steve has come into his own in the Oregon Pinot Noir market. The Lenn&eacute; Estate tasting menu includes five different examples of this finicky grape, including varying clones and blends, all of which have scored 91 or better from either Wine Enthusiast or Wine Spectator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/adelsheim_vineyard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.adelsheim.com\">Adelsheim</a>&nbsp;</strong>16800 NE Calkins Lane, Newberg, OR 97132, (503) 538-3652</p><p>Just as in Charles Dickens&#39; novel, The Christmas Carol, with the fictitious characters of The Ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, David Adelsheim, founder and co-owner of Adelsheim Vineyard, could easily be called &quot;The Father of Wineries Past, Present, and Future&quot;. &nbsp;When it comes to the Oregon wine industry, David is one of the original pioneers. And we were lucky enough to sit and talk with him, over a glass of his own wine, about the Oregon wine industry, how it was started and where he sees it in the future.</p><p>Back in 1971, at a time when Oregon was not yet proven as a bonafide viticultural area, David and his wife, Ginny, purchased 19 acres of land in the Chehalem Mountains near Newberg, with the intent of trying their hand at growing grapes and making wine. According to David, it really wasn&#39;t about making a living at that point, but more about moving to the country and finding something to do that he was interested in &ndash; the typical late 1960&#39;s, early 1970&#39;s, attitude of &quot;just being free and being me&quot;.&nbsp;</p><p>With advice from Dick Erath, who was also a rebel of the times having just planted his vines 3 years earlier, they began looking for land with a southerly slope and Jory soil. Once found, in the ground the grape vines went.&nbsp;</p><p>David reflected, saying that they would collaborate with these other pioneers (there were a total of ten of them at the time) about making &quot;great wine&quot;.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We talked very idealistically at the time and yet we had no idea what we were talking about!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We couldn&#39;t possibly have known what would come out 30, 40, 50 years later.&quot; And boy, was he ever right!</p><p>The year 1978 saw the first release of Adelsheim wines, and David, Ginny and the crew have been going strong ever since, as has the Oregon wine market which they helped to create.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/Vidon_Vineyard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"361\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://vidonvineyard.com\">Vidon Vineyard</a>&nbsp;</strong>17425 NE Hillside Drive &bull; Newberg, Oregon 97132, (503)538-4092</p><p>Engineer and NASA physicist Don Hagge began his journey into the world of vineyards 16 years ago, when, at the ripe young age of 69, he purchased his land in the Chehalem Mountains. That land has become Vidon Vineyard, but Don&rsquo;s legacy is as much built as it is grown.&nbsp;</p><p>Don, an engineer and physicist turned vineyard owner and inventor, cleared the land and planted 12.5 acres of vines including varietals of Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc, Viognier, Syrah, Tempranillo, and of course, several clones of Pinot Noir. But he didn&rsquo;t stop there.&nbsp;</p><p>As he saw the need, Don went on to improve the processes by which he creates his vino masterpieces.&nbsp;</p><p>Don employs only glass stoppers for his bottles, saying that it makes no sense to use a closure (cork) that has the opportunity to allow spoilage of the wine. With the decision to use only glass stoppers, Don saw the need to improve the inefficient method by which they must be inserted &ndash; by hand. Determined, Don designed and manufactured a bottling line specific for his production space that allows for machine insertion, a much quicker method, by far.</p><p>And, in an effort to improve wine preservation and dispensing, Don designed and built one such machine that utilizes argon gas to keep the wine fresh for up to two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Engineer, physicist and now vintner, Don exclaimed, &quot;You don&#39;t have to be a rocket scientist to make good wine, but it doesn&#39;t hurt if you are!&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"Scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/files/WVVA_YoungbergHill.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p><a href=\"https://youngberghill.com\"><strong>Youngberg Hill&nbsp;</strong></a>10660 SW Youngberg Hill Road, McMinnville, OR 97128, (503) 472-2727</p><p>Getting back to nature and simplicity, we introduce you to Wayne Bailey, owner and vintner of Youngberg Hill, whose philosophy and practice is simple &ndash; to stay out of Mother Nature&rsquo;s way and allow her to nurture the grapes naturally so they reflect where they were grown and the weather of the season.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne takes this philosophy even further, implementing the same simplistic attitude into Youngberg Hill&rsquo;s on-site bed and breakfast and event center. The property offers breathtaking views of the coastal range and the Willamette Valley, spacious and inviting rooms, and freshly hand-crafted breakfasts that are organic in every fashion.&nbsp;</p><p>But the true embodiment of the spirit of Youngberg Hills is Wayne and his wife, Nicolette. They are some of the most down to earth folks we have ever met. They exude this &quot;Welcome to our family&quot; feeling which, of course, made us feel right at home. We learned during our visit that this is very intentional.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne and Nicolette are all about family. Wayne, having grown up on a farm in Iowa, was raised with strong family values and a love of the land. Now he and Nicolette are doing the same for their children and strive to leave them the same legacy. They do this by applying organic and biodynamic farming to every aspect of their farm, from the vineyards to the livestock to the landscape, so that their daughters can enjoy the land for years to come. And their dedication to a &quot;hands off&quot; approach definitely shines through in their wines.&nbsp;</p><p>With a particular focus on Pinot Noir, and now with the addition of Chardonnay added to their vineyards and tasting room, along with one selection of Pinot Gris, Wayne brings the flavors of the different soils of Youngberg Hill to the bottle and the glass. At this tasting room, make sure to take your glass out on the veranda and enjoy the 360-degree scenery that surrounds you.&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see, whatever your tastes, you&rsquo;ll be sure to find something that you fall in love with in the Willamette Valley. When you visit, be sure to take your time, and to be inquisitive of the wine, the processes, and the passionate stories of the people who make it all come to life.

As the leaves change color and the weather grows crisper, celebrate the season with a glass of handcrafted hard cider at these up-and-coming Willamette Valley cideries.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.1859cider.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1859 Cider Co</a> -&nbsp;</strong>249 Liberty St NE #140, Salem, OR</p><p>Located in an alleyway in downtown Salem, you&rsquo;ll find 1859 Cider Co.&rsquo;s industrial styled taproom, where gleaming stainless-steel barrels of fermenting cider sit against the back wall. 1859 pays homage to Oregon tradition in a number of ways, not only through their name but also by locally sourcing all their ingredients just a stone&rsquo;s throw from their taproom doors. Their flagship cider, aptly named Statehood, is crisp, slightly dry, and an easy drinker for those new to the cider scene. Their Chemeketan Pear is a very tasty semi-sweet pear flavored cider - a perfect choice for those who want to branch away from apples. Also, don&rsquo;t forget Cherrian&rsquo;s Hard Cider, made from juicy heirloom cherries grown by 6th generation farmers just outside of Salem. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://2townsciderhouse.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 Towns Cider House</a> -&nbsp;</strong>33930 SE Eastgate Cir, Corvallis, OR</p><p>As one of the most widely distributed ciders hailing from the Willamette Valley, 2 Towns has grand ambitions but still remains committed to quality with &ldquo;no shortcuts.&rdquo; While their flagship Brightcider is more conventional in flavor, some of their other popular ciders are a bit more adventurous yet just as delicious. Take the Unfiltered Pacific Pineapple, or the Ginga Ninja - though these are highly original with very modern flavors, they are developed with traditional methods.</p><p>The taproom is located off Highway 34 just before Corvallis, and is an excellent place to meet with friends for a game of pool or a round of pinball. And don&rsquo;t forget to check out the quirky vending machine in back, which features plastic vampire teeth, tarot cards, and... well you&rsquo;ll just have to see for yourself! &nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.carltoncyderworks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carlton Cyderworks</a> -&nbsp;</strong>1036 NE Baker St, McMinnville, OR</p><p>Carlton Cyderworks brings business very close to home as they are a family owned and operated cidery dedicated to making traditional English-style cider from apples grown exclusively in their orchards. Some of their flagships include a whiskey barrel aged cider named Slake, and Citizen, an easy drinking semi-dry cider made from apples grown in Dundee. They also make batches of Estate Ciders, like French Lane, which exclusively features the apples of a single orchard by the same name. Their tasting room in McMinnville not only showcases their ciders, but it functions as a tap station with 36 rotating beers, soda and kombucha. Carlton Cyderworks also holds on to tradition by their dedication to transparency in their ingredients. While most ciders don&rsquo;t list on the bottle the specific amount and type of apples used for each batch, you&rsquo;ll find just such a list on every bottle, so you always know exactly what you&rsquo;re drinking. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://wildcraftciderworks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wildcraft Cider Works&nbsp;</a> -&nbsp;</strong>232 Lincoln St, Eugene, OR 97401</p><p>WildCraft Cider Works is devoted to developing innovative, artisanal dry ciders inspired by traditional and wild methodology.

You assume all risks as far as the quality and accuracy of the information; in other words, you&rsquo;re agreeing to use it at your own risk. Scenic Bikeway routes include roads with car and truck traffic, and are for cyclists that are comfortable riding in some amount of traffic. Cyclists must obey the rules of the road. For car-free riding, check out the Banks-Vernonia State Trail on the Tualatin Valley Bikeway and the Row River Trail section of the Covered Bridges Bikeway.<br><br>A must-know: In Oregon, a bicycle is legally considered a vehicle (and the same laws apply). Riding with the direction of traffic is the law; it&rsquo;s also the best way to be seen by motorists.<br><br>To demonstrate the best riding etiquette and promote good relations with motorists, please ride single-file. Riding side-by-side is legal, but only if doing so does not impede traffic. Be aware that many rural roads are used daily for commerce; there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll encounter large trucks carrying oversized loads.<br><br>Never forget about drivers&rsquo; blind spots &mdash; especially when the vehicle is turning right. If you&rsquo;re going straight at an intersection with stopped vehicles, pull in behind the first stopped vehicle in the lane and wait your turn to go, as if you were a motorist.<br><br>All bicycle riders in Oregon under 16 must wear a helmet.<br><br>For more information on riding safely and legally in Oregon, visit the <a href=\"https://www.oregon.gov/odot/programs/pages/bikeped.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon Department of Transportation.</a></p>","","","0",6,"Archive",NULL,"","","",0,NULL,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Page",NULL,"",0,NULL,NULL,"","",0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

But it also beckons with easy access to some of the most rewarding cultural experiences and outdoor recreation in Oregon.</p><p>A full picture won&#39;t come into view until you pull off the main roads and ease your foot off the pedal: cruising along quiet lanes with farms and nurseries, taking in historic city centers on foot, or hiking or cycling through seemingly endless trails under covered bridges or to misty waterfalls.</p><p>If it is a memorable day trip you are looking for, there are enough winding rivers, covered bridges, and scenic waterfalls to fill a month of Sunday drives. This fall we recommend you stay the weekend and attend one of our famous craft brew fests or hit up a hot spring or two - fit the right one for you here. There are plenty of hotels, but also sleepy tipis, vintage trailers, farm and vineyard stays to rest and restore.</p><p>Discover restaurants, breweries, places to stay and more in the itineraries below or in our <a href=\"http://www.journalgraphicsdigitalpublications.com/epubs/MEDIAMERICA/2016/WillametteValleyVisitorGuide2016/\">visitors guide</a>.
