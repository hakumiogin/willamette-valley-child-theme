AUTOMAGIC IMPORTS
Webpack has been configured to automagically load our variables and mixins
across all scss files while building the whole project. There is no longer the
need to include these in your scss. Abracadabra Alakascssam!

IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
that we'll be using across the whole project.

IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.

IMPORTING BREAKPOINTS
Here's where we begin our responsive design magic! Notice how we utilize
our screen mixins for responsive design. Start with base and use
these mixins throughout your scss as needed
